# Continuity v2

This repository holds the seed structure for Continuity v2, the next-generation
runtime continuity and archival engine for the StegVerse ecosystem.

Continuity v1 is preserved as an immutable legacy reference.  
Continuity v2 introduces parallel task lanes, autonomous worker integration,
expanded documentation structure, and the foundation for the OMEGA
self-expanding architecture.

## How to use this repo

This version contains only the initial files.  
Further structures—such as the task lanes, expanded diagrams, and full entity
definitions—are generated using the Continuity v2 bootstrap expansion workflow
or manual file placement.

## Key directories

- `docs/` — Core documentation for v2
- `docs/legacy/` — Space reserved for importing Continuity v1 snapshots
- `diagrams/` — Mermaid diagrams and architecture flows
- `entities/` — AI entity definitions (added in expansion)
- `.github/workflows/` — GitHub Actions for operation and expansion

## Purpose

Continuity v2 establishes a reproducible and maintainable baseline for automated
knowledge continuity, project lineage recording, organizational state scanning,
and safe parallel processing.
