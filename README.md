# 🌀 StegVerse Continuity v2 — Autonomous Continuity Engine (ACE)

> **Version:** 2.0  
> **Status:** ACTIVE (Authoritative)  
> **Supersedes:** Continuity v1 (StegVerse/Continuity)

Continuity v2 is the **central nervous system of StegVerse** — the system that maintains 
state, emits tasks, tracks org and repo evolution, and ensures StegVerse continues to 
operate even with **zero human activity detected**.

This is the **official upgrade** from Continuity v1.

---

# 🔥 Why Continuity v2 Exists

Continuity v1 was designed during the “Human Era” of StegVerse:  
- manually triggered scripts  
- patch-by-patch improvements  
- workflows without a unified state model  
- context preserved by human memory, chat logs, or notes  
- drift between repos/orgs forced manual reasoning

Continuity v2 (ACE) solves all of that by introducing:

### ✔ Autonomous awareness  
### ✔ State continuity  
### ✔ Multi-org ingestion  
### ✔ Parallel task generation  
### ✔ Knowledge graph memory  
### ✔ AI entity orchestration  
### ✔ Historical preservation  
### ✔ Drift detection  
### ✔ Zero-Ghost Token Policy alignment  
### ✔ Multi-generational architecture support

# 🧬 Continuity v1 → v2 Lineage

## **Continuity v1 (Legacy)**
- Human-guided
- Lacked global state ingestion
- No knowledge graph
- No autonomous tasks
- No parallel orchestration
- No continuity when humans were absent

Preserved in:
```
docs/legacy/
```

## **Continuity v2 (Authoritative)**
- Autonomous system
- State snapshots (`org_snapshot.json`, `repos_snapshot.json`)
- Graph model (`graph.json`)
- Automatic task emission (`docs/tasks/`)
- Cross-module awareness
- Versionable historic memory
- Drift analysis
- Fully documented lineage

# 🏗 Core Workflows (Active)

### 1. **SCE: Snapshot Org + Repos**
Captures the entire org state:
- repo list
- repo metadata
- naming drift
- branch metadata

### 2. **SCE: Build State Graph**
Turns snapshots into a continuity graph.

### 3. **SCE: Emit Parallel Tasks**
Creates parallel work lanes for:
- SCW Mesh expansion  
- Zero-Ghost Token Model  
- StegVerse.org build  
- Entity spawning  
- DriftScan  
- And more

### 4. **SCE: Ingest Conversation**
Allows StegVerse to understand the full research lineage.

### 5. **SCE: Pull Legacy Continuity**
Integrates Continuity v1 into the v2 timeline.

# 📚 Visual Documentation Placeholders

Screenshots should be added here for historical and forensic clarity:

- PAT validation tests  
- Ghost-boundary tests  
- Ghost heatmap results  
- Org drift confirmations  
- Repo lineage changes  

Use this format:

```

# 🧭 Upgrade Intent

Continuity v2 introduces:

### **1. Self-awareness**
The engine knows the state of all StegVerse modules.

### **2. Self-direction**
It emits autonomous tasks into worker lanes.

### **3. Self-maintenance**
It repairs drift, broken workflows, and dependency gaps.

### **4. Self-evolution**
It stores all conversations and decisions that led to system changes.

### **5. Self-governance**
AI entities operate under documented capability constraints.

# 🧩 AI Entities (v2)

Defined in:
```
entities/entities.max.json
```

These include:
- GhostWatch  
- PatchWarden  
- VaultGuard  
- ContinuityNode  
- RepoHealer  
- DriftScan  

Each has clear:
- Scopes  
- Outputs  
- Guardrails  
- Roles

# 🛠 Installing Continuity v2

1. Create repo:  
   `StegVerse-Labs/stegverse-continuity-engine`

2. Add files from the MAX bundle.

3. Add repo secrets:  
   - `GH_ORG_PAT`  
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (optional)  

4. Run workflows:
   - **Snapshot**
   - **Build Graph**
   - **Emit Tasks**

You now have a living StegVerse brain.

# 🧾 Version Logging

Every major change should be logged in:

```
docs/STATUS.md
```

AI entities will update this automatically via task completion.

# 🧠 Philosophical Foundations

Continuity v2 is built upon:
- The Ghost Credential Pattern  
- The Trust Drift Pattern  
- The StegVerse Security Philosophy  
- Zero-Ghost Token Model  
- StrangeAuth origins and VA insights  

This is the first autonomous continuity engine with narrative lineage.

# 🌀 Welcome to Continuity v2.

StegVerse is now capable of operating, evolving, and securing itself —  
even when no human is around to see it.
