# Continuity v2 — Concept Overview

Continuity v2 represents the transition from manual continuity management
(v1) toward an autonomous, parallel, and self-maintaining engine for the
StegVerse ecosystem.

## What is Continuity v2?

Continuity v2 is the “runtime memory and integrity layer” for StegVerse.
It preserves the historical record while generating the structures
needed to maintain autonomous progress across all modules.

It is designed around:

- **Parallel Lanes** — independent task domains that AI workers may claim.
- **Entity Governance** — well-defined AI roles and scopes.
- **Legacy Preservation** — v1 is never overwritten; all imports go into `/docs/legacy/`.
- **Self-Expansion** — via bootstrapping or MAX/OMEGA expansions.
- **Cross-Repo Awareness** — Continuity keeps StegVerse coherent even as modules multiply.

## Why a v2?

v1 captured conversations and moments manually;  
v2 handles automation, drift detection, state mapping, lane routing, and 
autonomous documentation in safe, governed ways.

v2 is the “spine” of StegVerse’s long-term resilience.

## Core Principles

1. **No loss of history** — everything is appended, never destroyed.
2. **Clear version governance** — v1 = human era, v2 = autonomous era.
3. **Safety-first AI rules** — no offensive actions; defensive continuity only.
4. **Deterministic growth** — expansion always follows declared manifests.
5. **Auditability** — every artifact is reproducible from seed.

## Relationship to v1

Continuity v1 remains the “source memory” of early development.
v2 does not replace v1 — it *frames, preserves, and builds upon* it.

All v1 material is stored inside `/docs/legacy/<timestamp>/`.

## Expansion Path

Continuity v2 is designed to evolve further into:

- **v2-MAX** — full repo expansion
- **v2-OMEGA** — parallel autonomous lanes + full entity registry
- **v3** — evolutionary AI continuity governance
