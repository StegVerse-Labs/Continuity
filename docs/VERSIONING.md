# Continuity Versioning Specification

This document defines how Continuity v1, v2, and future versions (v3+)
are structured, governed, and evolved.

---

## Overview

StegVerse continuity is divided into clear generational eras:

- **v1 — Human-Era Continuity**
  - Manually maintained
  - Organic structure
  - Independent files and notes
  - No parallel task lanes

- **v2 — Autonomous Continuity**
  - Structured lanes
  - AI entity governance
  - Bootstrap expansion
  - Drift detection
  - Legacy preservation
  - Multi-repo awareness

- **v3+ — Evolutionary Continuity**
  - Future versions are reserved for higher-order autonomy,
    such as entity quorum governance or self-governing architecture.

## Naming Conventions

Version numbers represent *capability era*, while codenames represent
*scope tier* of expansion.

### Examples:

- `v2` (core version)  
  - `MAX` — full expansion  
  - `OMEGA` — full parallel autonomous lanes  
  - `ALPHA` — minimal seed layer  
  - `DELTA` — experimental mode  

Codenames **never replace version numbers**.

## Version Rules

### **1. Versions never overwrite lower versions**
Each version adds capabilities but preserves all previous knowledge.

### **2. v1 is immutable**
All v1 material is archived exactly as-is in:

/docs/legacy/

### **3. v2 is authoritative for all active continuity**
All runtime continuity and new state goes into v2 files.

### **4. v3+ requires explicit design decisions**
A future version must be justified by new architectural capabilities, not just size.

### **5. Codenames describe expansion scope, not version**
Examples:
- v2-OMEGA  
- v2-MAX  
- v2-DELTA

## Future-Proofing

Versioning ensures:

- Safe expansion  
- Auditability  
- Determinism  
- No accidental overwriting  
- Clear lineage in StegVerse’s long-term continuity story

This framework allows Continuity to grow indefinitely without losing structure.
