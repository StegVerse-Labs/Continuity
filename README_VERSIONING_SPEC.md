# Continuity Versioning Specification

This spec explains how continuity versions evolve.

---

# 📘 v1 — Human Era
- Reasoning lived in human memory + scattered notes
- No state ingestion
- No org drift management
- No autonomous behavior
- No guarantee of survival when inactive

Preserved in: `docs/legacy/`.

---

# 🚀 v2 — Autonomous Era (Current)
- Over-System activated
- Knowledge graph created
- Autonomous task emission
- Drift detection
- AI entity orchestration
- Multi-org awareness
- Narrative lineage preserved

Repo: `stegverse-continuity-engine`.

---

# 🧬 v3 — AI-Evolving Era (Future)
To be activated only when:
- AI entities consistently perform autonomous tasks
- Entities demonstrate reliable governance behavior
- Zero-Ghost Token Policy fully implemented
- StegVerse reaches multi-org, multi-module self-healing

v3 introduces:
- generational reasoning  
- self-replication safeguards  
- multi-entity consensus  
- continuity quorum protocols

# 🛡 Version Rules

### Rule 1 — A version cannot overwrite history  
v1 is always archived unchanged.

### Rule 2 — A version must include “why it exists”  
Document rationale + structural goals.

### Rule 3 — A version must define expected behavior  
v2 → autonomous continuity.

### Rule 4 — A version must provide guardrails  
Especially for AI entities.

### Rule 5 — A version must be reproducible  
Snapshots stored under `/docs/state` and `/docs/legacy`.
