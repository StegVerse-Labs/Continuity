# Legacy Preservation Protocol (LPP)

Legacy data (Continuity v1) must be:

### ✔ Pulled automatically when needed  
### ✔ Stored immutably  
### ✔ Never overwritten  
### ✔ Never deleted  
### ✔ Always referenced during major system decisions  

Legacy is a critical part of:
- narrative lineage  
- forensic analysis  
- security evolution  
- trust drift documentation  
- genealogical architecture  

Legacy is not “old code”  
Legacy is **root memory**.
