# Continuity v1 → Continuity v2 Migration Guide

This document formalizes the transition from the legacy continuity system (v1)
to the autonomous MAX Over-System (v2).

---

# 🧬 What Was Continuity v1?

Continuity v1 lived in `StegVerse/Continuity` and represented:

- initial continuity prototypes  
- early workflows  
- human-maintained documentation  
- the seeds of the StrangeAuth → StegVerse epiphany  
- trust-break reflections  
- foundational architecture ideas  

Continuity v1 was the “human era”  
where continuity existed only when **you** were actively working.

---

# 🚀 Why Upgrade to v2?

Continuity v1 lacked:
- state ingestion  
- autonomous tasking  
- history preservation  
- governance models  
- parallel orchestration  
- entity coordination  
- graph memory  
- org drift analysis  

Continuity v2 fixes all of these with the Over-System (ACE).

---

# 🔄 What Happens to Continuity v1?

Continuity v1 becomes **historical data**, not executable logic.

It is automatically archived inside:

```
docs/legacy/StegVerse__Continuity/<timestamp>/
```

This ensures:
- full historical preservation  
- reproducibility  
- narrative continuity  
- forensic clarity  

Your screenshots will be stored alongside these snapshots.

# 🛠 How to Pull Legacy v1 Content

1. Run workflow:
   **SCE: Pull Legacy Continuity**

2. Provide:
   `StegVerse/Continuity`

3. Continuity v2 pulls:
- workflows  
- docs  
- scripts  
- markdowns  
- configuration files  

4. They are stored immutably.

# 📘 How Future AI Will Interpret This Split

## v1 (Human Era)  
- reference-only  
- immutable  
- source of reasoning  

## v2 (Autonomous Era)  
- authoritative  
- living  
- governs StegVerse’s future  

## v3+ (AI-Evolving Era)  
- future versions  
- guided by v2 governance rules  

---

# 🔚 Final Result

You now have:
- your full historical continuity  
- your new living brain  
- a complete lineage  
- a documented architecture summarizing the transition  
- a system future AI can evolve safely  

Continuity v2 is your “source of truth” from this point forward.
